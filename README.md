# Classifying Names with RNNs and CNNs in PyTorch

This repo contains a tutorial on [RNNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) and [CNNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) based on the [name classification with RNNs example](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.html) by [Sean Robertson](https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch).  In that tutorial, the RNN is implemented from scratch. Here I'll use PyTorch's build-in RNN and LSTM implementations and compare results with a CNN classifier implemented in PyTorch and a simple Naive Bayes classifier implemented in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). Please note that this tutorial is not done and may contain many errors!  I'm making the incomplete code available as I finish it in-case it may be useful. Caveat emptor!
