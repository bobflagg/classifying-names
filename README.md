# Classifying Names with RNNs and CNNs in PyTorch

This repo contains a tutorial on RNNs and CNNs in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) based on the [name classification with RNNs example](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.html?highlight=lstm)
by [Sean Robertson](https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch).  In that tutorial, the RNN is implemented from scratch. Here I'll use the PyTorch's build-in RNN and LSTM implementations and compare results with CNN classifier implemented in PyTorch and a simple Naive Bayes classifier implemented in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html).
